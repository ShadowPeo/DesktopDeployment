# DesktopDeployment

This repoisitory is to host the scripts I use for automation of the deployment of my desktop environment after a rebuild, the goal is to have the packages I use catalogued, and tagged so that I can pull and deploy by tag. This is going to use winget for Windows as an example as it is native in Windows and I want to keep things to native offerings as much as possible, concequently the Windows version will be built in powershell, any other systems I need will be built using tools required to do that at the time. Hopefully doing package management this way will allow upgrades to processed more easily and on a scheduled basis
